rain rain come
wash away the pain
with demons in my head
vengeance is the only way
we had love before the end
we had trust,
belief and friendship
maybe something more
maybe something less
this is how I make amends
for the light I turn to darkness
shedding blood until it's done
rain rain come wash away
this god damn pain pain
now vengeance is the only way
I'll make you beg
make you pray
until your heart stops
until your heart stops
you'll be wishing you were dead
because an eye or a tooth
won't be all that you lose
I'll make you pay for
what you did
here I stand a broken man
just a ghost stuck in the past
maybe something more
maybe something less
in my soul I know I can
try to find a way to heal
but this pain it tells me
where to go and what to do
I'll make you beg
make you pray
until your heart stops
until your heart stops
you'll be wishing you were dead
because an eye or a tooth
won't be all that you lose
I'll make you pay for
what you did
♪
there's no other way
to end this pain and sorrow
take me to that place
take me to tomorrow
how could I ever forgive
when I cannot forget
take me to that place
take me to tomorrow
take me to tomorrow
I'll make you beg
make you pray
until your heart stops
until your heart stops
you'll be wishing you were dead
because an eye or a tooth
won't be all that you lose
I'll make you pay for
what you did
