"Love With A Vengeance"

Don't wanna make it easy
Can't help but make you hard
The way I see you bounce around makes me doubtful, makes my green eyes brown
I know you like sportin'
The changes in you often does
You'll get your up and coming
And your perspective
As it was

If life seems like reversal you may be right 'cause I'll love
You with a vengeance not for spite
If that seems like forgiven you could be right 'cause I'll love
You with a vengeance not for spite

So if we lived in darkness
(Na, na, na, na, na)
Before electricity
(Na, na, na, na, na)
You'd be lit up with a spotlight
(Na, na, na, na)
And you'd stand out
Theres no one else I'd see

If that seems wishful thinking you're probably right 'cause I'll
Love you with a vengeance not for spite
If that seems wishful thinking you're probably right 'cause Ill
Love you with a vengeance not for spite

Well I try to
Well I try to
Get ya back, get ya back, get ya back
Get ya back, get ya back, get ya back
I'll attack you
(I'll attack you)
Instinctively, I will follow
(Well I try, Well I try, get you back)
But handsome is as handsome does
(Get you back, and I try to, and I try to, get you back)
You're famous for your trick or treatin'
(Get you back, get back at you, get, get you back get back at you,)
Well, I'm waitin'
(Get you back, get you back, get back at you)
For my sugar buzz
(Get you back, get you back, get back at you)

Could it be a force of habit
(Na, na, na, na, na)
Your behavior often does
(Na, na, na, na, na)
Love traction, love selection
(Na, na, na, na, na)
I'm on a tag team and didn't know I was

If that seems like a mission you may be right 'cause I'll love you
With a vengeance not for spite
If that seems kind of crazy I guess you're right 'cause I'll love
You with a vengeance not for spite
If life seems like reversal you may be right 'cause I'll love you
With a vengeance not for spite
(Not just for spite)
If that seems like forgiven you could be right 'cause I'll love
You with a vengeance
(Get you back, get you back, get back at you)
Not for spite
(Get you back, get you back, get back at you)
If this seems like a mission you may be right 'cause I'll love you
With a vengeance
(Or should I try to)
Not for spite
(Should I try to)
If that seems kind of crazy
(Get you back, get you back)
I guess you're right
(Get you back, get you back)
'Cause I'll love you with a vengeance
(Get back at you, get you back)
Not for spite
(Get you back, get you back, get you back, get back at you)
Should I try to
Should I try to
Will I try to
Build you up or attack you
Should I
Should I
Should I try to
